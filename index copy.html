        <p>
          Three months into coding, Tsing created this portfolio to showcase 7
          projects from Critical Computation class for MFA in Design and
          Technology at Parsons School of Design. While mostly using p5.js,
          several highlighed projects also explores alternative control (such as
          eye-tracking and gestural) in web-based interactive experiences. Enjoy
          browsing~

        <h3>Lost Weaver: Thread by Thread</h3>
        <p>
          Step into the delicate world of a spider—a creature burdened by a
          missing instinct. As the player, you guide this lost weaver, teaching
          a skill all spiders are destined to master. No keyboard, no mouse—just
          your hands captured by your webcam. Spider's survival hangs by a
          single thread. Will the dance of your hands weave the threads of hope?

          <h3>Optical Illusion</h3>
          <p>
            I have been increasingly interested in eye tracking technologies and
            was inspired by the screen protection/ encrypted webpage examples
            mentioned in CC lecture. I decided to create an interaction where
            the encrypted pattern of an eye reveals itself when a user gaze at
            the screen. If you are having trouble callibrating the facial
            recognition / eye tracking, here is the
            <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tsingliu2020/sketches/z4yCqFImd"
              >link</a
            >
            to mock up where the interaction is triggered when mouse is pressed.
