        <p>
          Three months into coding, Tsing created this portfolio to showcase 7
          projects from Critical Computation class for MFA in Design and
          Technology at Parsons School of Design. While mostly using p5.js,
          several highlighed projects also explores alternative control (such as
          eye-tracking and gestural) in web-based interactive experiences. Enjoy
          browsing~

        <h3>Lost Weaver: Thread by Thread</h3>
        <p>
          Step into the delicate world of a spider—a creature burdened by a
          missing instinct. As the player, you guide this lost weaver, teaching
          a skill all spiders are destined to master. No keyboard, no mouse—just
          your hands captured by your webcam. Spider's survival hangs by a
          single thread. Will the dance of your hands weave the threads of hope?

        <h3>Experimental Clock</h3>
        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from a recent hike to Harriman State Park at the
          beggining of autumn, I saw the change of seaons in the gradients of
          leaves. What if I could control or reserve time or season? I created a
          wheel where you can drag the mouse to control the gradient. Clockwise
          movement = green to red; anti-clockwise = back to green. Random radius
          of the circle is also generated every 30 seconds to create visual
          variation.
        </p>
        <p>Drag mouse to control rotation; press any key to restart.</p>

        <h3>Optical Illusion</h3>
        <p>
          I have been increasingly interested in eye tracking technologies and
          was inspired by the screen protection/ encrypted webpage examples
          mentioned in CC lecture. I decided to create an interaction where the
          encrypted pattern of an eye reveals itself when a user gaze at the
          screen. If you are having trouble callibrating the facial recognition
          / eye tracking, here is the
          <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tsingliu2020/sketches/z4yCqFImd"

          to mock up where the interaction is triggered when mouse is pressed.

        <p>Click while looking at the cursor to begin callibration.</p>
