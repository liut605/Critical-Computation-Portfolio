      Initially I started with the subjective perception of time. The more
      engaged/less bored we are, the faster we perceive time to pass by. I
      created clusters of circles to represent oscillatory movements of neurons.
      The more neurons there are, the faster they move and the faster time
      passes. But there is no end to it. The screen eventually fills up with
      circles and creates a sense of chaos. I was also struggling with a less
      traditional representation of time other than the line circling in the
      background. Here is the link to my first experiment in case you are
      curious: https://editor.p5js.org/tsingliu2020/sketches/NFwDbEbQv -->

      I'm a quite stubborn/persistent person who tends to hold onto concepts
      personal to me. But because I didn't find any sentimental value of the
      concept. I moved onto another idea.

      Drawing inspiration from a recent hike to Harriman State Park at the
      beggining of autumn, I saw the change of seasons in the gradients of
      leaves. What if I could control or reserve time or season? I created a
      wheel where you can drag the mouse to control the gradient. Clockwise
      movement = green to red ;anti-clockwise = back to green. Random radius of
      the circle is also generated every 30 seconds to create visual variation.

      I enjoyed the challenge of writing if else conditions using movedX,
      mouseX, and dividing the canvas into four quartets.

      Here are a lis of things I hope to improve on: 1) Refine the gradient (not
      quite the colors I intended) 2) Hone the mouse dragging. I'm happy with
      the accuracy of closkwise and anti-clockwise mouse dragging altering the
      direction of the line, but I would like to introduce the speed at which
      you drag the mouse as a variable of how fast the movement is.
